The checkers game is operating as expected. Due to some design choices,
I had some difficulty testing some of my methods as I would utilize turtle
and many methods do not have a return. This was likely my biggest
takeaway - design my program in a way that takes advantage of the ease of
testing methods/functions that return something.
